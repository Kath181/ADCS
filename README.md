# FINCH ADCS
The Attitude Determination and Control subsystem (ADCS) is the satellite subsystem responsible for controlling the orientation of a satellite in space. In the case of both aircraft and spacecraft, the term attitude refers to the orientation of the spacecraft in a given reference frame. ADCS systems are crucial to satellites for a number of different reasons. In the case of FINCH, the mission does have a point requirement 0.004 deg as of summer 2022. The ADCS must maintain this attitude accurately, with high stability for a long enough period of time to facilitate clear images. 

# Purpose

This repository contains MATLAB/Python program files for sharing between members of ADCS subsytems pertaining to specific projects they might be working on. We are currently developing the code the FINCH satellite ADCS.
